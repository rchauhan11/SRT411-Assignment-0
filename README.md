# SRT411-Assignment-0: Intro to R and Github

# Introduction:
This assignment will be helpful in understanding basic commands and tools of R studio. Fisrtly, to complete the To-do list, the provided website, https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf
can be used. After, next task will be to learn how to convert .Rmd file to .pdf file using knitr.
# Description:
This is an individual assignment. No group work.

For this course, you are going to complete the exercises in the document "A (very) short introduction to R", and publish the report and the code to go with it, on github. If you read the document, you will find a good introduction to the R programming language, including some examples.

The document in question has 14 different "Todo" sections throughout. You must write the code to demonstrate each Todo, and include it in a document as described below.

Additionally, you must complete one final Todo of my own making, as follows:

# Todo
________________________________________
The final Todo in the document has a footnote. Write code that will prove that footnote true
________________________________________
You will use knitr to generate a pdf file showing your code, and the answers (charts and/or data)
Resource:
How to present your data science portfolio on Github

# The Documents

You must create a Rmd document in correct Rmd format using knitr, as described in the following:
•	R Markdown — Dynamic Documents for R (large resource)
•	Writing reproducible reports in R with markdown, knitr and pandoc
•	Markdown
•	knitr with R Markdown
•	R markdown cheatsheet

# This document must show the following:

•	The user name you used for your github account.
•	A short introduction, describing the assignment 
•	a link to the document we are using
•	the code you used to complete the Todo, plus the result of running the code. (use knitr code to produce this)
•	Acknowledgements of any sources you used to complete the assignment, including those I have mentioned here.
•	The document must be named SRT411A0.Rmd.
•	The Rmd document must show the results of your code.
You MUST also generate a pdf file showing the results of your code, generated with the knitr command.
Your Submission

# WARNING: 
If you do not follow these guidelines exactly, you will receive zero for this assignment. I will not mark assignments that do not follow these guidelines exactly.
You must create your own Github account, make a repository entitled "SRT411 Assignment 0" and push your code and documentation to that repository.
The following files must be present and correct:

•	a readme file describing this assignment, including an attribution to the original assignment file
•	the Rmd file
•	the pdf
While the tutorials on Github should be enough, there are Github tutorials in Lynda if you need more instruction.

Once finished, you must upload to Blackboard a plain unformatted text file which contains the name you used for your Github account, and a html link to the repository for this assignment.
